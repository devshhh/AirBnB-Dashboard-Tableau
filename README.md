# AirBnB-Dashboard-Tableau
While learning about Tableau, I came across a youtube video series from Alex the Analyst. At the end of the series, they guided in making a dashboard for AirBnB data. AirBnB-Dashboard-Tableau is a dashboard developed to visualize AirBnB prices in various locations of United States. The dataset used is of the year 2016-2017. The dashboard represents valuable insights to someone looking to buy a property that can be listed on AirBnB.

# Visualization of the Dashboard

## Average Price per Bedrooms
It gives a valuable insight on how the prices vary according to the number of bedrooms consisted in the property. It can provide a good approximation on the price that can be charged for the property according to the number of bedrooms it contains.

## Distinct Count of Bedroom Listings
It tells us about the number of times a property with particular number of bedrooms is booked. Here, it shows that properties with a single bedroom brings the highest number of bookings.

## Price per Zipcode
It gives a visual insight on a geographical map on the average price of properties in a particualar zipcode in the United States.

## Average price by Zipcode
It provides a graph plot of the average price against a particular zipcode in descending order.

## Revenue for Year(2016)
It tells us that around which time of the year the prices for a property are higher and we can expect more bookings during which period of the year.
